So I started out development just a couple of months back. I recently finished my target of development for 200 hours. Here’s what all I have learned about development  through this short and interesting journey :

 ####General Learnings (Non Technical)
 
1. Learning development is fun and fullfilling experience.

2. As you build more and more things, the projects will get better and more fun.

3. With every project you will gain confidence and more skills.

4. Building things and working with problems and solving them is the most effective way to learn about anything.

 ####Techinal Learnings 

1. Basic CSS and Sass : Mostly I learned about flex and positioning in CSS and basics of Sass. 
Also I learnt about using color combinations and implementing dark mode theme. 
<!-- Here are some interseting blogs and articles which helped me learn CSS.   -->

2. Fundamentals of Javascript : I worked a lot with VanillaJS, and learnt about DOM manipulation. 
This helped me understand importance of ReactJS and other JS frameworks. I also worked with some web api's which was quite fun.

3. Socket.io : I loved working on a chat application based on Socket.io which removed my fear of networking apps.

4. Basic MERN Stack : I also worked on developing a Fullstack ap using the MERN technologies. It was a much needed project to remove fear of fullstack apps. 

5. Markdown : Well nothing to say here
