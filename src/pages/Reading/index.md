So I started out reading just a couple of months back. I recently finished my target of reading for 100 hours. Hereâ€™s what all I have learned about reading books through this short and interesting journey :

* Reading is a fun and addictive activity.
* Books are informative and a great source of wisdom.
* Reading can be hard and easy depending on the book.
* There is superabundance of great books.
* Books vary greatly and offer much more variety than any other source.
* Reading books can be relaxing and fascinating.

Well, I liked this experiment of mine. I am still curious about what the next book has to offer and thus will continue reading for now
